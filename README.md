# GigaDraw
## The Ultimate Oberon Drawing App (almost)
### About

**GigaDraw** is a simple drawing application implemented in and running on Oberon systems. It features a genuine black and white drawing engine and an intuitive user interface using Oberon *commands*, coming right out of the 90ties. ;)

### History

The original code compiled and ran on Oberon V4 (the name of the operating system) on a Ceres-3 computer. The Ceres 3 computer was the third iteration of a computer using the National Semiconductor NS320xx CPU. The logic board around it was designed by the computer systems group led by professor Niklaus Wirth.

**GigaDraw** was developed as a student exercise during the "Systemsoftare" lectures given by professor Niklaus Wirth in the winter semester 1998/99 at the ETH. It was developed in a team of two students.

I took Niklaus Wirth's 85th birthday in 2019 as an occasion to "google for Oberon" and I stumbled across "Oberon Core", an Oberon port in the Mac App Store which implements the latest "Oberon 2013" (Oberon V5) which is an even more simplified version of the previous V4, based on the also refined Oberon-07 language.

Naturally our original **GigaDraw** code did not compile right away, but the idea to "port it into the new century" was born :)
